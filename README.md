### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank">Create React App</a>.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">`npm start`</a>: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
- <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests" target="_blank">`npm test`</a>: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
- <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment" target="_blank">`npm run build`</a>: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
- <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration" target="_blank">`npm run eject`</a>: **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!** If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own. You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Recent Updates

### Fixed Navigation Error in ProductScreen

-   Replaced the usage of `history` with `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` in the `ProductScreen` component to fix the runtime error when pressing the "Add to Cart" button.

```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function ProductScreen () {
  // ...existing code...
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  // ...existing code...
  const addToCartHandler = () => {
    navigate(`/cart/${id}?qty=${qty}`);
  };
  // ...existing code...
}
```

### Updated Redux Store Configuration

- Updated the `store.js` file to load cart items and user info from local storage into the initial state.

```javascript
const cartItemsFromStorage = localStorage.getItem('cartItems')
  ? JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cartItems'))
  : []

const userInfoFromStorage = localStorage.getItem('userInfo')
  ? JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('userInfo'))
  : null

const initialState = {
  cart: { cartItems: cartItemsFromStorage },
  userLogin: { userInfo: userInfoFromStorage },
}
```

### Fixed Import Error in cartReducers.js

- Corrected the import statement in `cartReducers.js` to use the correct constant name `CART_ADD_ITEM`.

```javascript
import { CART_ADD_ITEM } from '../constants/cartConstants'
```

### Fixed Navigation Error in CartScreen

- Replaced the usage of `match` and `location` with `useParams`, `useLocation`, and `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` in the `CartScreen` component to fix the runtime error.

```javascript
import { useParams, useLocation, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function CartScreen() {
  const { id: productId } = useParams();
  const location = useLocation();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const qty = location.search ? Number(location.search.split('=')[1]) : 1;
  // ...existing code...
}
```

### Updated Route for CartScreen

- Updated the route for `CartScreen` in `App.js` to make the `id` parameter optional.

```javascript
<Route path='/cart/:id?' element={<CartScreen />} />
```

### Added Styling for Shopping Cart Links

- Added CSS styles to remove the underline from shopping cart links and only show underline on hover.

```css
.cart-link {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: inherit;
}

.cart-link:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

### Added Remove from Cart Functionality

```sh
# Install Postman from https://www.postman.com/downloads/
```

### Updated UserSerializer

- Updated the `UserSerializer` to include additional fields and added `UserSerializerWithToken` for JWT authentication.

```python
class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    name = serializers.SerializerMethodField(read_only=True)
    _id = serializers.SerializerMethodField(read_only=True)
    isAdmin = serializers.SerializerMethodField(read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ["id", "_id", "username", "email", "name", "isAdmin"]

    def get__id(self, obj):
        return obj.id

    def get_isAdmin(self, obj):
        return obj.is_staff

    def get_name(self, obj):
        name = obj.first_name
        if name == "":
            name = obj.email
        return name

class UserSerializerWithToken(UserSerializer):
    token = serializers.SerializerMethodField(read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ["id", "_id", "username", "email", "name", "isAdmin", "token"]

    def get_token(self, obj):
        token = RefreshToken.for_user(obj)
        return str(token)
```

### Updated Views for JWT Authentication

- Updated the views to use `UserSerializerWithToken` for JWT authentication.

```python
class MyTokenObtainPairSerializer(TokenObtainPairSerializer):
    def validate(self, attrs):
        data = super().validate(attrs)

        serializer = UserSerializerWithToken(this.user).data
        for k, v in serializer.items():
            data[k] = v

        return data

class MyTokenObtainPairView(TokenObtainPairView):
    serializer_class = MyTokenObtainPairSerializer
```

### Added User Registration and Profile Endpoints

- Added endpoints for user registration and profile retrieval in `user_views.py`.

```python
@api_view(["POST"])
def registerUser(request):
    data = request.data
    try:
        user = User.objects.create(
            first_name=data["name"],
            username=data["email"],
            email=data["email"],
            password=make_password(data["password"]),
        )

        serializer = UserSerializerWithToken(user, many=False)
        return Response(serializer.data)
    except:
        message = {"detail": "User with this email already exists"}
        return Response(message, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)


@api_view(["GET"])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def getUserProfile(request):
    user = request.user
    serializer = UserSerializer(user, many=False)
    return Response(serializer.data)
```

### Fixed Navigation Error in LoginScreen

- Replaced the usage of `history` with `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` in the `LoginScreen` component to fix the runtime error when navigating after login.

```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function LoginScreen() {
  // ...existing code...
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  // ...existing code...
  useEffect(() => {
    if (userInfo) {
      navigate(redirectPath);
    }
  }, [navigate, userInfo, redirectPath]);
  // ...existing code...
}
```

### Added Error and Loading States in LoginScreen

- Added error and loading states to the `LoginScreen` component to display appropriate messages and loaders during the login process.

```javascript
import Loader from '../components/Loader';
import Message from '../components/Message';

function LoginScreen() {
  // ...existing code...
  const { error, loading, userInfo } = userLogin;
  // ...existing code...
  return (
    <FormContainer>
      <h1>Sign In</h1>
      {error && <Message variant='danger'>{error}</Message>}
      {loading && <Loader />}
      // ...existing code...
    </FormContainer>
  );
}
```

### Updated Redux Action for User Login

- Updated the `login` action in `userActions.js` to handle user login and store user information in local storage.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
import { USER_LOGIN_REQUEST, USER_LOGIN_SUCCESS, USER_LOGIN_FAIL } from '../constants/userConstants';

export const login = (email, password) => async (dispatch) => {
  try {
    dispatch({ type: USER_LOGIN_REQUEST });

    const config = { headers: { 'Content-type': 'application/json' } };

    const { data } = await axios.post('/api/users/login', { username: email, password }, config);

    dispatch({ type: USER_LOGIN_SUCCESS, payload: data });

    localStorage.setItem('userInfo', JSON.stringify(data));
  } catch (error) {
    dispatch({
      type: USER_LOGIN_FAIL,
      payload: error.response && error.response.data.detail ? error.response.data.detail : error.message,
    });
  }
};
```

### Updated README Structure

```markdown

### Fixed Navigation Error in LoginScreen

- Replaced the usage of `history` with `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` in the `LoginScreen` component to fix the runtime error when navigating after login.

### Added Error and Loading States in LoginScreen

- Added error and loading states to the `LoginScreen` component to display appropriate messages and loaders during the login process.

### Updated Redux Action for User Login

- Updated the `login` action in `userActions.js` to handle user login and store user information in local storage.
```

- Updated the Header component to display a user dropdown with **Profile** and **Logout** options.
- Integrated logout functionality using Redux dispatch.
- Adjusted the routing implementation to be compatible with react-router-dom v6.
- Replaced deprecated usage of LinkContainer in favor of React Bootstrap's `as={Link}` prop where necessary.
- Fixed the user registration endpoint by ensuring the registration URL includes a trailing slash (`/api/users/register/`) to avoid POST redirection errors.
- Disabled the bootstrap source map warning in the frontend by adding an `// eslint-disable-next-line` comment above the bootstrap CSS import.
- Added a registration screen and updated the routing to include it.
- Implemented logout functionality in the Header which removes user info from local storage and dispatches the logout action.
- Added ProfileScreen component to display user profile and update user details.
- **Updated ProfileScreen:**  
  • Integrated the update profile action so that when a user updates their details (name, email, password) the  profile is refreshed.  
  • Implemented a reset (`USER_UPDATE_PROFILE_RESET`) after a successful update

- **Fixed Navigation Errors:**
  - Replaced deprecated usage of `history` with `useNavigate` in components such as ProductScreen and LoginScreen.
  - Updated CartScreen to use `useParams`, `useLocation`, and `useNavigate` for smoother navigation.

- **Router Consolidation & CheckoutSteps Update:**
  - Ensured the app is wrapped by a single `<Router>` in `index.js`.
  - Replaced `LinkContainer` with React Bootstrap's `Nav.Link as={Link}` in the CheckoutSteps component for proper routing.

- **PaymentScreen & Order Flow Integration:**
  - Added routes for PaymentScreen and PlaceOrderScreen in the main App.
  - Updated PlaceOrderScreen to compute order summary (items, shipping, tax, total) without directly mutating the Redux store’s state, preventing runtime mutation errors.

- **Redux Store & Cart Reducer Enhancements:**
  - Configured the Redux store to preload state from local storage.
  - Refined the cart reducer to update state immutably and derive calculated values correctly.

- **User Authentication & Profile Improvements:**
  - Improved login, registration, and profile update flows with error/loading state management.
  - Updated JWT authentication implementation using djangorestframework-simplejwt.

- **CheckoutSteps Navigation Fix:**  
  Replaced `LinkContainer` with `Nav.Link` using the `as={Link}` prop in the `CheckoutSteps` component to ensure proper routing within the single `<Router>` context.

- **PaymentScreen Integration:**  
  Added a new route for `PaymentScreen` in `App.js` and updated navigation in the shipping and cart screens accordingly.

- **General Routing & State Management Updates:**  
  Updated navigation functions to use `useNavigate` from React Router v6, and refined Redux integration across authentication and profile update flows.

- **Cart Reducer State Mutation Fix:**  
  Updated the cart reducer to avoid direct state mutations. Now, when items are added or removed, the state is updated immutably and derived values (e.g., itemsPrice) are computed from a new array, ensuring correct behavior and adherence to Redux best practices.

- **Navigation & Routing Enhancements:**  
  Refined the use of `useNavigate` in components such as ShippingScreen and CartScreen by consolidating the Router setup in `index.js` and eliminating duplicate Router wrappers.

- **CheckoutSteps Component Update:**  
  Replaced usage of `LinkContainer` with React Bootstrap's `Nav.Link as={Link}` to ensure correct navigation within the app's single Router context.

- **Fixed State Mutation in PlaceOrderScreen:**
  - Updated the `PlaceOrderScreen` component to calculate `itemsPrice`, `shippingPrice`, `taxPrice`, and `totalPrice` without directly mutating the Redux store's state. This fix ensures that the state is not mutated directly, preventing the uncaught runtime error.

- **Last Job Done:** Streamlined navigation and state management by updating routing to use react-router-dom v6 hooks, refining Redux store initialization with local storage preloading, and enhancing error/loading states in authentication.

## Product Carousel Update

The Product Carousel component now uses custom styling. The carousel items have updated image styles and captions:
- Images are displayed as block elements with a height of 300px, a padding of 30px, a margin of 40px, and a border-radius of 35%.
- Captions are positioned at the top of the carousel.
- Responsive adjustments are applied when the viewport width is under 900px.

## Merging React Files With Django Project

To integrate the React frontend with the Django backend:
1. Build the React app:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```
2. Copy or move the generated build folder to Django's static files directory (e.g., `backend/static`), or configure Django to include the frontend build directory in `STATICFILES_DIRS` in `backend/settings.py`.
3. Update Django templates to load the React app's index.html as the entry point.
4. During development, you can run the React development server and Django server concurrently.
